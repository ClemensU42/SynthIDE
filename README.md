# Synth IDE
Synth IDE is an IDE targeted towards developing audio synthesizers for use in music production.
Programming a synth is done via a simple-to-use node graph, with the ability to
program custom nodes and compile to both VST3 plugins and STM32-based hardware synthesizers.

## Installation
Currently, there is no release to install. So if you want to test this project out, feel free to clone this
repository and follow the development documentation to see how you can build and test this project yourself!
